This is an example of how to generate Early Bound classes for your entities using the CrmSvcUtil.exe located in your SDK folder under SDK\Bin
Remember, using early bound style is optional, but it does have the benefit of writing code with typed objects and possibly reducing runtime errors

  - In your CRM, locate the correct endpoint URL:
    1. Go to settings->customizations->Developer Resources
    2. Grab the 'Organization Service' Endpoint address
    3. Should look like: http://cobaltdev82/JCATraining/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc


  - Open up Powershell and navigate to SDK\bin


  - Your command should be something like:

./CrmSvcUtil.exe /url:http://cobaltdev82/JCATraining/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc /out:GeneratedEntities.cs /username:cam.abreu@cobalt.net /password:somePassword /namespace:JamCamBarebonesCrm.entities

  - if powershell hangs seemingly forever, just push a key and it should give you something like:
    "Code written to C:\DynamicsSdk_2015\SDK\Bin\GeneratedEntities.cs."

  - Now in the solution explorer, use "add existing" to add the GeneratedEntities.cs
